# Introduction

To practice SQL learned from the course https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA&t=14676s, this was the sample project that was developed as part of hands on course.
The repository contains application of topics in the form of practice problems as well as the sample project.

# Tools I used

- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database.
- **PgAdmin:** The administration and management platform providing database server administration.
- **Visual Studio Code:** IDE to write queries, making use of the IDE plugins to connect to DB as well as the formatting for SQL. Plugins used are `SQLTools` and `SQLTools PostgreSQL/Cockroach Driver`.
